### Questions

* What is a cookie?
 * *Round and delicious treat.*
 * *Or it might be a piece of information that your browser saves.  It's set/created by a website you're visiting.*
* What’s the difference between a session and a cookie?
 * *A session is very similar to a cookie, but a session hash is encrypted by the server.*
* What’s a flash and when do you want to use flashes?
 * *A flash is a notice that should only show up on one page load.  It is like an expiring cookie.  We use flashes to inform hte user when something has happened (created a user, successfully logged in) or didn't happen (didn't create a user because no email was provided...).*
* Why do people say “HTTP is stateless”?
 * *Because in Switzerland (where the internet was born), they're called Cantons, not states!*
 * *Or it might be because the server (in the client-server arrangement), does not keep track of requests from the same machine.  That is, each new page request is viewed as a standalone request with no previous history.  It's like talking with Dory.*
* What’s authentication? Explain.
 * *Authentication is about proving you are who you claim to be.*
* What’s the difference between authentication and authorization?
 * *Authorization is concerned with, now that we know who you are, what are YOU allowed to do?  Are you a user, super-user, admin?*
* What’s a before filter?
 * *
* How do we keep track of a user once they’ve logged in?
* When do you want to namespace a resource? When do you want to nest a resource? What's the differences between those two approaches?
* At a high level, what tools can you use to implement authorization? How would you use them?
* What's an enum, and what advantages does it offer? What data type needs to be in your database to use an enum? Where do you declare an enum?
* What are some strategies you can use to keep your views DRY?
