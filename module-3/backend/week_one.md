## Week One - Module 3 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week (which is a TON!). 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is `json` and why is it important?
 * *JavaScript Object Notation, and it is an efficient way for the browser to accept/pass information.*
2. What's the difference between `joins` and `includes` in ActiveRecord?
 * *Inludes seems to load a larger SQL query into memory at one time - for perfomance benefits.*
3. What's an API?
 * *Application Program Interface.  It's a way to provide information from your app in a machine- and human-readable format.*
4. How do we test an internal API (in general)?
 * *Generally we test that the various routes/endpoints are providing the data we expect.*
5. What are two different ways to customize your `json`?
 * *We can use Serializer and decide which attributes to share OR we could use something like jbuilder and treat our JSON almost like views - which allows for a lot of flexibility with which attributes we provide and how it is formatted.*
